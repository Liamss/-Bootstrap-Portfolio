## Learnings / Future Work 

1. Image cards have the same width but varying height - tried to resize images and overlay CSS 
2. Removing Card titles and having the whole element clickable, seems to be best achieved in Javascript which we'll start this week. 
3. Learning to keep CSS to a minimum when it can be achieved in bootstrap, still working out the balance.

My plan is to get closer to this using Bootstrap.
